## Installation

```
npm install -D @mseeley/jest-cases
```

## Usage

It would be time well spent to first learn about Jest's [`test.each`](https://jestjs.io/docs/en/api#testeachtable-name-fn-timeout) before adding a dependency to this utility.

If you're undeterred then please enjoy the [API Documentation](docs/index.md). The [specs](lib/index.spec.js) also provide good insight into operations and usage.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome. Please see ensure that your code and commit message
pass linting requirements. See the `scripts` member of this repo's

## History

Releases follow standard version. Please see our [`CHANGELOG.md`](CHANGELOG.md).

This utility is inspired, but entirely independent, of [`jest-in-case`](https://github.com/atlassian/jest-in-case).
